# TODOs: Implementing True ROMA (Recursive-Open-Meta-Agent) Pattern

## üéâ Major Implementation Achievements

**We have successfully implemented the core ROMA pattern!** The system now features:

1. **‚úÖ LangGraph DAG Execution**: Replaced custom scheduler with proper LangGraph StateGraph for native DAG handling
2. **‚úÖ Dynamic Agent Factory**: Capability-based agent creation with medical, legal, technical, business specializations  
3. **‚úÖ Recursive Sub-Agent Spawning**: ExecutorNodes can spawn sub-ROMA trees with budget inheritance and depth guards
4. **‚úÖ Budget Inheritance**: Parent budgets distributed to children with recursion limits
5. **‚úÖ Successful Test**: UTI management query executed successfully with 408 tokens in 6.02s

**Test Results**: The system correctly identified medical keywords, created specialized medical research agents, and generated comprehensive evidence-based UTI management guidelines for CA-ON with proper citations.

## Current State Analysis

We now implement a real ROMA scaffold: `ROMANode` abstract base, concrete `AtomizerNode`, `PlannerNode`, `ExecutorNode`, `AggregatorNode`, recursive `ROMATree`, `StageTracer`, and specialized agent cache. Below are remaining deltas vs. full ROMA:

### ‚úÖ Implemented
- ROMA nodes and transitions with async execution
- Planner consumes JSON plan; dependencies interpreted to split seq/parallel
- Stage tracing across node lifecycle
- Agent caching per type; basic specialized agents created on demand
- Parallel execution via asyncio.gather for independent tasks
- **Dynamic Agent Factory** with capability-based agent creation
- **LangGraph DAG Scheduler** for proper dependency execution
- **Executor-level recursive sub-agent spawning** with budget inheritance
- **Budget inheritance and recursion guards** to prevent resource exhaustion

### üß© What Full ROMA Still Requires (Based on [Sentient's ROMA](https://blog.sentient.xyz/posts/recursive-open-meta-agent))
- **Four Node Types**: Every task is a node that can be Atomizer ‚Üí Planner ‚Üí Executor ‚Üí Aggregator
- **Atomizer Logic**: Assess if task is simple enough for single agent or needs breakdown
- **Planner Decomposition**: Break complex goals into subtasks with dependencies (sequential/parallel)
- **Executor Actions**: Perform subtasks using appropriate tools/agents
- **Aggregator Synthesis**: Combine child results and synthesize final answers
- **Recursive Tree Structure**: Each node follows same decision logic, creating deep task trees
- **Transparent Context Flow**: Structured Pydantic inputs/outputs for full traceability
- **Modular Agent/Tool System**: Plug in any agent, tool, or model at node level
- **Natural Parallelization**: Independent sibling nodes execute in parallel

## Implementation Plan: Phase-by-Phase ROMA Transformation

### Phase 1: ROMA Node Architecture üß†
**Priority**: COMPLETE  
**Status**: Done in code

#### Remaining Tasks:
- [x] **1.7**: Harden plan parsing to tolerate malformed JSON and partial results
- [x] **1.8**: Include execution_strategy semantics in scheduling decisions

#### Expected Outcome:
ROMA node structure like the [blog example](https://blog.sentient.xyz/posts/recursive-open-meta-agent):
```python
# Root node: Atomizer determines task is complex
root_node = AtomizerNode(goal="Climate differences between LA and NYC")
# Becomes Planner, creates subtasks:
subtasks = [
    ExecutorNode(task="Research LA climate", tools=[WeatherAPI, SearchTool]),
    ExecutorNode(task="Research NYC climate", tools=[WeatherAPI, SearchTool]), 
    ExecutorNode(task="Compare climates", depends_on=["LA_research", "NYC_research"])
]
# Aggregator synthesizes final report
final_result = AggregatorNode.synthesize(child_results)
```

### Phase 3: Recursive Sub-Agent Spawning üîÑ
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED

#### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks:

### Phase 5: Context-Aware Agent Communication üì°

  - Asynchronous agent communication
  - Context subscription system
- [ ] **5.3**: Create smart context filtering (agents only get relevant context)
- [ ] **5.4**: Add context versioning and conflict resolution
- [ ] **5.5**: Implement context-aware prompt building

#### Expected Outcome:
Agents communicate intelligently:
```python
# Legal agent needs technical context from code agent
legal_context = await code_agent.get_context("architecture_decisions")
# Business agent subscribes to legal findings
business_agent.subscribe_to_context(legal_agent, "regulatory_constraints")
```

- [ ] **6.4**: Implement agent reputation system
- [ ] **6.5**: Create adaptive task routing based on agent performance

#### Expected Outcome:
Self-organizing agent networks:

‚Üí Data-Agent: "I can provide datasets"  
‚Üí Statistics-Agent: "I can run analysis models"
‚Üí Auto-formed coalition handles the task
```
