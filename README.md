### Overview

This repo hosts practical agentic patterns you can copy, adapt, and compose into your own systems. Each pattern focuses on real product concerns:

- ⚡ Lower latency with parallelism and early stopping
- 🛡️ Higher reliability with structured fallbacks and judging
- 💸 Lower cost by spending where it matters (previews vs full answers)
- 👀 Better observability with logs/metrics/hooks
- 🧩 Composable pieces you can mix-and-match

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please:

- Keep modules self‑contained with a clear `README.md` and minimal dependencies
- Prefer small, composable abstractions over frameworks
- Include a quickstart and a realistic example per module

If you’re unsure where to start, open a discussion or a small draft PR — we’re friendly 🙂
